## I. Node Packages

### 1. TypeScript

TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript. It adds optional static types to JavaScript, enabling better tooling and scalability for large applications. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript and works on any browser, host, or OS.

### 2. Husky

Husky simplifies the process of adding Git hooks to your project. It helps automate tasks such as linting, testing, and formatting code before commits and pushes, ensuring code quality and consistency.

### 3. lint-staged

`lint-staged` allows you to run linters and formatters on staged Git files, ensuring that only checked and formatted code is committed. You can configure tasks for specific file patterns, which are then applied only to files staged for commit, improving efficiency.
